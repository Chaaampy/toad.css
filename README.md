# toad.css
## toad.css is just my (very) tiny CSS grid system
###### Feel free to use / customize it / suggest some improvements

## Grid

The main container is 980px width

Here is the different combination with the grid system

Just add a toad-container class to your wrapper, and then add the t-1, t-2, t-3 â€¦ classes to the columns

Want to clear the float ? Add the toad-clear class to any element

You can also add a toad-full (100% width) or a toad-fullscreen (100vw width) class to any element

## Reponsive

The grid system has 2 major breakpoints (feel free to add some) :

- 980px (smaller than a 'normal' desktop screen)
- 500px (smaller than a 'normal' tablet screen)

## Files

Here are the dev file (CSS), the LESS file and the prod file (min CSS)
